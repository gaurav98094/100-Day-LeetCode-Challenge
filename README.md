# 100-Day LeetCode Challenge
<hr>

Welcome to my 100-Day LeetCode Challenge repository! In this repository, I will be solving one LeetCode problem every day for the next 100 days. This challenge is a great way to improve my coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and algorithmic thinking.
I am starting this challenge from <b>29th October 2023</b>.

## Why am I doing this challenge?

- To enhance my problem-solving skills.
- To become more proficient in data structures and algorithms.
- To maintain a consistent coding habit.
- To track my progress and see how my skills improve over time.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **[Day X](./DayX/)**: Inside each day's directory, you will find the solutions and explanations for the problem solved on that particular day. I will also include any relevant code and documentation.

## Code Style

I will strive to write clean, well-documented code in various programming languages. I'll include explanations and comments in my solutions to make them easy to understand, not only for myself but also for others who might be following along.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the code and explanations for each problem. You can also use this repository as a reference for your own LeetCode practice. If you have any questions, suggestions, or improvements, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.
